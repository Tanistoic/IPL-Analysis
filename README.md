Matches won based on toss decision (bat/field).

Matches won based on result type (normal, super over, DLS, etc.).

Season-wise wins by all teams across the IPL history.


## What I Learned
During this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

Using Power Query to handle messy data and make it analysis-ready.

Writing DAX measures for dynamic calculations.

Building interactive visual dashboards using Power BI Desktop.

Understanding how to structure data models and relationships for performance.

Designing reports that can answer multiple business questions from one interface.


## The Conclusion
This dashboard provides a flexible and interactive way to:

Pull up performance metrics for any team or player.

Explore seasonal summaries or league-wide trends.

Compare match outcomes and strategic patterns based on venue, toss decisions, and game types.

It's a powerful tool for fans, analysts, or stakeholders to get quick, visual insights into the IPL's rich data landscape.
